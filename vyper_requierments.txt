# Always use vyper in a venv (suggested by most of the community). This is to ensure that the installed packages are isolated from the main python installation
# instructions for creating a venv having python version 3.13 
# !python3.13 -m venv .venv # create a virtual environment
# !source .venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
# !deacitivate # deactivate the virtual environment
# !pip install vyper # install vyper
# !vyper vyper_tutorial.py # compile the smart contract

# Setting up ganache cli test environment for testing the smart contract (It is different from the GUI for web3.py library)
# !sudo npm install -g ganache 

# You can hence build a simple smart contract using vyper -  "Hello world" smart contract
